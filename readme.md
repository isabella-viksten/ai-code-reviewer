### Eyevinn Open Source Cloude mode

If you want to run this project in a cloud environment you can run it as a service on [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](www.osaas.io). All you need to do is to create a free account and try it out!

## Installation / Usage

% npm install
```

### Running the server

To start the server you can run the following command:

```bash
% OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key npm run dev
```

or

```bash
% OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  OPENAI_REVIEW_ASST=openai_asst_id \

Frontend is available at http://localhost:8000/ and API docs at http://localhost:8000/api/docs

When both the server and frontend is up and running you can provide a gitHub URL in the GUI and the AI will review the code and provide feedback.

The api.ts file is the entry point for the server and contains the routes and the logic for the server.
